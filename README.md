# Binary Trees

##  Description

This project introduces and explores the use of **binary trees**, a fundamental data structure in computer science. It involves the implementation of various tree types, insertion functions, traversal algorithms, and evaluation techniques, following Holberton's coding standards and best practices in C.

##  Project Objectives

- Understand what a binary tree is and how it is structured.
- Distinguish between a binary tree and a binary search tree (BST).
- Evaluate the performance gain compared to linked lists.
- Implement functions to calculate properties such as depth, height, and size of the tree.
- Apply different tree traversal algorithms.
- Identify the types of binary trees: complete, full, perfect, and balanced.

##  Key Concepts

- **Binary Tree**: A data structure where each node has at most two children.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree with ordering rules that allow faster searching.
- **Time Complexity**: Balanced binary trees can significantly outperform linked lists.
- **Depth, Height, Size**: Metrics used to describe nodes and trees.
- **Traversal Methods**: Preorder, Inorder, Postorder, Level-order.
- **Tree Types**: Complete, Full, Perfect, Balanced.
